# Name-path chain formatting

afmt keeps the dot glued to a pure dotted-identifier path, such as
`System.Assert` or `Schema.SObjectType`, because Apex rejects whitespace before
the dot when the path is parsed as a type or namespace reference. This applies
to every dot in the path, including dots before a later member.

The formatter uses only the syntax tree for this rule. It does not resolve
identifiers against a symbol table or Salesforce type list, so a path beginning
with a variable is glued as well. Value expressions are not treated as name
paths: method calls, array access, and SOQL expressions can break before a
following member when their chain group overflows, while object creation,
literals, parenthesized expressions, and `this` or `super` retain their own
existing expression break opportunities.

This is a canonical reflow rule: existing whitespace before a name-path dot is
repaired rather than preserved. The battle-test script includes a syntactic
check for any remaining line-start dot whose preceding nonblank line is a pure
dotted-identifier path.

When a chained expression follows a multiline string literal, the literal's
interior lines are preserved and width accounting resumes at the closing
delimiter's column. That prevents an earlier assignment from breaking solely
because the literal contains newlines; the trailing chain still wraps when its
own final line exceeds the configured width.
